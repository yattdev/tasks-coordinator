# Coordinator learning-cycle log

## 2026-08-21 — stale sessions and gate ownership

- Captured physical workflow-gate ownership: ad-hoc Work-stage review evidence
  does not skip Review/QA, while a physical exact-head Review PASS must not wait
  on downstream CI.
- Added stale `RUNNING` diagnosis and recovery: verify process/output/timestamp,
  stop repeated queue writes, respect parent-scoped stop authority, and replace
  only a wedged caller session when necessary.
- Recorded that database writes, credential extraction, and shared-backend
  restarts are not task-control recovery mechanisms.
- Added containment guidance for an unauthorized history rewrite and a fresh
  LAN-instance/credential inventory procedure.
- Files: `docs/RUNBOOK.md`, `docs/DECISIONS.md`, `README.md`, and this log.
- Policy commit: `4d98343` (`docs(coordinator): harden stale session recovery`).
- Merge result: shared `main` fast-forwarded successfully to the policy commit;
  no conflicts. The log/link commit was then fast-forwarded separately.
- `PROMPT.md` was unchanged, so no live task-description mirror was required.
